# About
This project provides an easy way how to use the "Ken Burns" effect in your angular application.

All animations are pure CSS3 animations for the sake of the performance.

# How to install
Assuming you have installed node.js and therefore also npm (node package manager), run the following command:

``
 npm install
``

This is going to install all necessary node packages.
This project uses gulp so just simply run ``gulp`` to build, mininfy the coffee scripts and SCSS files.

(Currently there's an issue when you try to run the ``gulp`` command. The ``clean`` task tends to fail. Rerunning this task solves the problem. Sorry :( )


# How to use it
All functionality is contained in a angular [module](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module). This module exposes a [directive](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive).
